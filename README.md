# Solid Clean Architecture Study

Welcome to the Solid Clean Architecture Study project! This repository contains a sample implementation of a software project following the principles of Clean Architecture and SOLID design principles. The goal of this project is to provide a clear and structured example of how to architect a software application for maintainability, testability, and scalability.

## Overview

The Solid Clean Architecture Study project is structured using the Clean Architecture approach, which separates the application into distinct layers to ensure modularity, separation of concerns, and easy maintainability. The project follows SOLID principles, which promote clean and flexible code design.

### Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/src**: Contains the source code of the application.
  - **/app**: Implements the application-specific logic and use cases.
  - **/domain**: Defines the core domain entities and business logic.
  - **/interfaces**: Contains interfaces and contracts that define interactions between different layers.
  - **/presenters**: Handles the presentation logic and interfaces with external systems.
  - **/repositories**: Implements data access and storage interfaces.
- **/tests**: Contains unit tests and integration tests for the application.
- **/docs**: Stores any documentation related to the project.
